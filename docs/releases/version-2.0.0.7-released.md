# Version 2.0.0.7 Released

**Date: 30th Apr 2026**

**Real-Time Performance Update: WebSocket Subscribe Batching across Dhan, Fyers & Upstox, Sandbox Event-Driven UI Updates, IIFL Capital Market Data Expansion & Flow Editor Stability**

This is a stability and performance update covering **26 commits** since v2.0.0.6. The headline change is a unified rewrite of WebSocket subscribe handling across three major brokers (Dhan, Fyers, Upstox) — instead of N per-symbol POSTs that hit broker rate limits and occasionally lost ticks for freshly-placed orders, subscriptions are now coalesced into batched grouped flushes. This closes a long-standing class of bugs reported across issues #1304 / #1314 / #1318 where ticks for newly-placed sandbox orders never reached the execution engine, manifesting as "price oscillates through the trigger but the order never fires." Combined with sandbox event-driven UI updates over the existing `analyzer_update` SocketIO channel, the OrderBook / TradeBook / Positions panes now refresh the moment a fill commits.

***

**Highlights**

* **WebSocket subscribe batching (Dhan, Fyers, Upstox)** — Per-symbol subscribe POSTs are now collapsed into single grouped flushes per broker. Closes the entire class of "freshly-placed order is invisible to the sandbox execution engine" bugs (issues #1304, #1314, #1318).
* **Sandbox event-driven UI updates** — Engine-internal fills, auto-square-off, and T+1 settlement now emit on the existing `analyzer_update` SocketIO channel. OrderBook / TradeBook / Positions refresh automatically the moment a fill commits.
* **IIFL Capital market data expansion** — Master contract optimization plus full historical data, quotes, depth, order, and margin API support (#1309, #1319). Brings IIFL Capital up to feature parity with the other Tier-1 brokers.
* **Fyers WebSocket overhaul** — Six separate fixes: HSM subscribe batching, positional-index → `brsymbol` mapping, shared dispatcher registry across reconnects, per-symbol OI gated to FNO-only with a >50-symbol skip, multiquote OI ceiling raised to 100, and index ticks fanned out to both Quote and Depth subscribers.
* **Dhan rate-limit hardening** — Minimum request interval bumped to 1.1s to stay under Dhan's "Order Received N in current second exceeds Limit 10" / 805 threshold.
* **Flow Editor stability** — Condition nodes honor their UI fields (and respect both `true/false` and `yes/no` edge handles), `{{var}}` interpolation supports list indexing, the Expiry node has a Futures/Options dropdown, the Config Panel scrolls on small viewports, and the Execution Log scroll is fixed.
* **Broker symbol normalization** — mstock `instrumenttype` normalized to `CE/PE/FUT` (Angel format), tradejini `expiry` stored as `DD-MMM-YY` (Zerodha format) — reduces broker-specific branching downstream (#1312).
* **Profile page UI fix** — Broker API secret no longer overflows the container or leaks the secret length through visual width.
* **Sandbox stale-field guard** — Drops `price` / `trigger_price` from order payloads based on `pricetype`, preventing leftover values from a previous order type from polluting the next placement.
* **Option chain exchange flip** — Underlying and expiry are now cleared atomically when the user flips the exchange dropdown, eliminating a transient mismatched state.
* **CI security scan resilience** — When `bandit`'s SARIF formatter crashes (a known upstream bug), the security scan no longer fails the entire CI run.

**Real-Time / WebSocket**

**Dhan**

* `1a80afb8` — `fix(dhan/ws): batch subscribes to collapse per-symbol WS messages into grouped flushes (#1314)`
* `5aa1156f` — `fix(dhan): bump min request interval to 1.1s to avoid 805 rate limit`

**Fyers**

* `671b8548` — `fix(fyers/ws): batch HSM subscribes to collapse N symbol-token POSTs into one`
* `5eb7baaa` — `fix(fyers/ws): join HSM<->Tradeboard mapping through brsymbol, not positional index`
* `55129e6c` — `fix(fyers/ws): use shared dispatcher registry so multi-flush reconnects don't drop ticks`
* `15c2c63b` — `fix(fyers/multiquotes): per-symbol OI for FNO only, skip when >50 symbols`
* `81cecdbd` — `fix(fyers/oi-tracker): raise multiquote OI ceiling to 100, narrow OI tracker to 47 strikes`
* `b25bc931` — `fix(fyers/ws): fan out index ticks to both Quote and Depth subscribers`

**Upstox**

* `b9e44488` — `fix(upstox/ws): batch subscribe queue, LTPC carry-forward, larger reconnect budget`

The "price crosses trigger but pending sandbox order never fires" pattern reported across multiple brokers is fully resolved by these batching fixes. Ticks for freshly-placed orders now reliably reach the sandbox execution engine.

* `d3981b26` — `fix(sandbox): drop stale price/trigger fields by pricetype`

***

**Brokers**

**IIFL Capital (#1309, #1319)**

* `73857264` — Master contract optimization plus full market data API: historical, quotes, depth.
* `3ba5bf08` — Order API and margin API update.

**mstock**

* `df267180` — `instrumenttype` normalized to `CE/PE/FUT` to match Angel format.

**tradejini**

**Dhan / Fyers / Upstox** — see Real-Time / WebSocket above.

* `0f4f71f0` — `docs(flow): add prompt-style JSON import reference for the Flow Editor`

***

**UI / UX**

* `92b5c877` — `fix(ui): broker API secret no longer overflows / leaks length on Profile page`
